Using a text corpus comprised of the eight articles from the special issue of Poetics on the subject of topic models, we run a topic model on these articles, both as a way to introduce the methodology and also to help summarize some of the ways in which social and cultural scientists are using topic models. We review some of the critiques and debates over the use of the method and finally, we link these developments back to some of the original innovations in the field of content analysis that were pioneered by Harold D. Lasswell and colleagues during and just after World War II.},

	abstract = {As a new education product in the information age, Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)
	command momentous public attention for their unexpected rise and flexible application. However,
	the striking contrast between the high rate of registration and the low rate of completion has put their

	the emotional tendencies of learners in order to analyze the acceptance of the courses based on big
	data from homework completion, comments, forums and other real-time update information on the
	MOOC platforms. Through emotional quantification and machine learning calculations, graduation
	probability can be predicted for different stages of learning in real time. Especially for learners
	with emotional tendencies, customized instruction could be made in order to improve completion
	and graduation rates. Furthermore, we classified the learners into four categories according to
	course participation time series and emotional states. In the experiments, we made a comprehensive
	evaluation of the students’ overall learning status by kinds of learners and emotional tendencies.
	Our proposed method can effectively recognize learners’ emotional tendencies by semantic analysis,
	providing an effective solution for MOOC personalized teaching, which can help achieve education

Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), a member of a family of methodological approaches that offers an opportunity to address this gap by describing the semantic content in textual data as a set of vectors, was pioneered by researchers in psychology, information retrieval, and bibliometrics. LSA involves a matrix operation called singular value decomposition, an extension of principal component analysis. LSA generates latent semantic dimensions that are either interpreted, if the researcher's primary interest lies with the understanding of the thematic structure in the textual data, or used for purposes of clustering, categorization, and predictive modeling, if the interest lies with the conversion of raw text into numerical data, as a precursor to subsequent analysis. This paper reviews five methodological issues that need to be addressed by the researcher who will embark on LSA. We examine the dilemmas, present the choices, and discuss the considerations under which good methodological decisions are made. We illustrate these issues with the help of four small studies, involving the analysis of abstracts for papers published in the European Journal of Information Systems.},

Given this interest in \{BIM\} and the rapidly increasing volume of \{BIM\} literature, it is important to understand and discern the core themes and trends emerging in \{BIM\} research, and its implications for broader research. The previously reported studies to identify the core of \{BIM\} research are typically subjective and qualitative, and hence, prone to bias and interpretation of a limited number of reviewed papers. There is a lack of comprehensive, quantified and systematic classification of the \{BIM\} literature. This research brings some clarity by synthesizing and labeling a large corpus of \{BIM\} research studies published from 2004 through 2014. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), a natural language processing technique was applied to the abstracts of 975 academic papers. This objective analysis reveals twelve principal research areas. Various specific research themes associated with each principal area have been identified. These principal research areas and research themes indicate the patterns and trends in \{BIM\} research. },

Unlike manual tagging, which is effort intensive and requires expertise in the documents’ subject matter, topic analysis (in its simplest form) is an automated process. Relying on the assumption that each document in a collection refers to a small number of topics, it extracts bags of words attributable to these topics. These topics can be used to support document retrieval or to relate documents to each other through their associated topics. Given the variety and amount of textual information included in software repositories, in issue reports, in commit and source-code comments, and in other forms of documentation, this method has found many applications in the software-engineering field of mining software repositories. This chapter provides an overview of the theory underlying latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), the most popular topic-analysis method today. Next, it illustrates, with a brief tutorial introduction, how to employ \{LDA\} on a textual data set. Third, it reviews the software-engineering literature for uses of \{LDA\} for analyzing textual software-development assets, in order to support developers’ activities. Finally, we discuss the interpretability of the automatically extracted topics, and their correlation with tags provided by subject-matter experts. },
