Data science can be used across a number of industries in order to be beneficial for the society. For example in agriculture, there are now Agrobots and drones being used to gauge the health of the harvest that can help farmers improve their crop yield and reduce costs. With the help of advanced technologies, weâ€™re able to save 90% of the spraying costs. These technologies can help states like Punjab which has always been the food basket of India to rehabilitate food security while improving crop health.\\
