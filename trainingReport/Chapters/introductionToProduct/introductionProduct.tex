\section{Overview}
Software bug reports are an important source of information for software development and maintenance. During	resource allocation, a project manager distributes time and effort for each project task and assigns appropriate developers. 

It has been investigated that research scholars spend a significant time of total research period on identifying the current and promising research areas. Even after choosing a specific research area, the prevailing research trends are not always well understood. Thus, the research area selection is critical and a time-consuming process. The researchers perform manual literature reviews to reveal the research gaps, but they are often subjective and biased. 

The core idea behind this work is to use an unsupervised technique (topic modeling) to identify the latent semantic patterns from the bibliographic database. It would answer the research questions viz. the prevailing trends and the topics which are required for research problem framing. The model automatically clusters the text documents into one or more defined number of categories. The model has been developed by using Python because of it's strong string class with powerful methods.
